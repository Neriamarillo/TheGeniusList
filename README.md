# TheGeniusList

The Genius List is designed to demonstrate API handling in an Android application.  
List will auto-populate from the API and will process the adding a user POST request on clicking the Floating Action Button.  

## Architecture
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) for the ease of use and ease of code readability
* [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) to perform HTTP requests to an API
* [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) to convert JSON data from JSON objects for processing
* [Picasso](https://square.github.io/picasso/) for hassle-free image loading
* [CircleImageView](https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView) to make ImageViews a bit neater and circular
